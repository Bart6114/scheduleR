- add FTP upload
- redirect stderr to log
- look at day/month full name vs numeric ?
- look at name of included file in email attachments
- show last edit timestamp + by whom
- name of outputfiles: time based tags? e.g. %y-%m-%d
- optimise query of logs (getting overview is slow - mostly due to getting statuses)
